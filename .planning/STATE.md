# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** A business planner can transform a fuzzy idea into well-researched, audience-correct, compliance-aware deliverables — without already knowing what they want when they start.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation — Fork Hygiene, Removal, Rename

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Foundation — Fork Hygiene, Removal, Rename)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped to 9 phases (54/54 coverage)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: 9-phase structure (fine granularity), foundation split into Phase 1 (hygiene + rename + A1 verification) and Phase 2 (stable seam + A4 verification + workstream-as-yaml + caps) for risk isolation
- Roadmap creation: Bidirectional Phase 1↔2 return-stack built BEFORE designers (Phase 6 before Phase 7) so designers are written aware of it from day one
- Roadmap creation: ALIGN gate (Phase 4) built BEFORE AUDIENCE (Phase 5) and COMPLIANCE (Phase 7) so the gate-as-orchestrator-step pattern is set once, replicated twice

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **HIGH-RISK assumption A1 (zero-runtime-deps)** must be verified in Phase 1 before any new code; if wrong, BRIEF can freely add `gray-matter`/`ajv` to dependencies, otherwise inline implementations are mandatory
- **HIGH-RISK assumption A4 (state.cjs round-trip)** must be verified in Phase 2; if wrong, the architecture needs a sidecar `state-brief.json` instead of namespaced `state.brief.*` extension and changes propagate to Phase 6 (bidirectional foundation)
- Korean compliance reference library content (clause-level ISMS-P / PIPA / e-금융업 / mydata / 의료기기법) needs deeper Korean legal research during Phase 7; consider engaging legal counsel for review
- Marp `npx --yes` invocation pattern (Assumption STACK-A4) needs verification across all four runtime sandboxes in Phase 9 cross-runtime smoke test
